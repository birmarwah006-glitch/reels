"""
Meal planner — a real lecture in, a connected Meal series out.

    30-minute Python project  ->  12-15 Meals  ->  by the last one you can
                                                    build the project yourself

This is the piece the product rests on, and it is deliberately NOT chipper.
Chipper segments on a 20-minute sliding window with MAX_MODULES=8; that is
duration-driven, and the product rule is that the SOURCE DURATION MUST NOT
DETERMINE THE MEAL COUNT — learning objectives do. Chipper still contributes
what it is good at: the transcript and the timestamps that let a Meal cite its
source.

Three passes, deliberately separable so a bad one can be re-run alone.

  PASS 1  COMPREHEND
      Read the whole lecture at once. What is being built? What concepts does
      it actually teach? What ANALOGIES does the teacher use, verbatim? What
      code gets written? What is filler?

      The analogies matter more than they look. A lecturer who says "a
      dictionary is like a phone book" has already done the hard work of
      making the idea land for this audience. Inventing a fresh analogy throws
      that away and risks one that is subtly wrong. So they are extracted and
      carried through to the Meals that need them.

  PASS 2  CURRICULUM
      Turn comprehension into an ORDERED list of learning objectives, one per
      Meal. Constraints that are checked, not just requested: strictly
      increasing dependencies, no duplicate objectives, coverage of the whole
      build, and a count that follows the material rather than a target.

  PASS 3  AUTHOR
      Write each Meal against the canonical schema, in series order, with the
      preceding objectives in context so Meal 7 can build on Meal 6 instead of
      re-teaching it.

Accuracy is enforced by execution, not by trust: every Meal's code is run for
real by verify.py afterwards, and a Meal whose code does not run is not
publishable.

#    right for a chat route, where a dead LLM should degrade to "no answer",

#    that could never succeed. podcastengine.llm_chat is called directly
#    instead so the real error survives.
#
# 2. Groq's free tier allows 8000 tokens PER MINUTE. A 45-minute lecture is
#    ~13k tokens, so a single whole-lecture call is not merely slow, it is
#    impossible. Everything below is budgeted around that ceiling.

is any moment where the teacher explains a new thing by comparing it to
something the learner already knows. Two kinds matter, and the second is the
one most often missed:

  EVERYDAY   "a variable is like a labelled box", "a function is a recipe"
  TECHNICAL  "you access it like a dictionary", "this is basically a list",
             "it is very similar to XML", "think of it as a for loop"

In a programming lecture the TECHNICAL comparisons are usually the more
valuable of the two, because they connect an unfamiliar API to something the
learner has already learned. Capture phrases of the form "like a X", "similar
to X", "basically a X", "the same idea as X", "think of it as X".

Capture them VERBATIM. The teacher has already found a comparison that works
for this audience; that is hard-won and easy to throw away. Do not paraphrase,
and do not invent new ones. If the lecture genuinely uses none, return an
empty list — a fabricated analogy is worse than none.

CURRICULUM_SYSTEM = """You are designing a MAROS Meal series from an analysed
lecture.

A Meal is one short lesson — 30 to 90 seconds — built around exactly ONE
learning objective. A series of Meals is watched in order, and by the last one
the learner should be able to build the thing the lecture builds.

Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no prose.

THE RULES THAT MATTER:

1. ONE MEAL = ONE LEARNING OBJECTIVE. If an objective needs the word "and" to
   state it, it is two Meals.
2. THE COUNT FOLLOWS THE MATERIAL. Do not pad to reach a number and do not
   compress to be brief. A lecture with twelve real ideas gets twelve Meals.
3. STRICT ORDER. Meal N may only rely on what Meals 1..N-1 have taught, plus
   general knowledge. Never forward-reference.
4. SUFFICIENCY. Taken together the series must actually get someone to the
   finished artifact. Do not skip the unglamorous steps that the build needs.
5. NO FILLER. Course admin, greetings, tangents and repetition do not become
   Meals.
6. REUSE THE TEACHER'S ANALOGIES. If the analysis captured an analogy for a
   concept, attach it to the Meal that teaches that concept. Do not invent new
   analogies.
7. BE HONEST ABOUT CODE. Only attach code you can actually justify from the
   lecture. A Meal with no code is fine."""

AUTHOR_SYSTEM = f"""You write a single MAROS Meal: one short lesson, 30-90
seconds, teaching exactly ONE objective.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching the shape given. No markdown, no prose.

THE SCRIPT IS READ ALOUD by a text-to-speech voice. Write only words a person
would say. No markdown, no arrows, no bare symbols. Write "input" not
"input()", "arrow" not "->". Spell out anything a voice cannot pronounce.
Under {SCRIPT_WORD_CAP} words total — this is a hard cap.

VOICE: a smart person explaining something to another student. Direct,
slightly energetic, never lecturing. Bad: "In today's lesson we will discuss
the concept of loops." Good: "You have ten thousand names. How do you make
Python do the same thing to every one?"

THE HOOK is the first one to three seconds and it decides whether anyone
watches. Make it a real question, a surprising fact, or a problem the learner
recognises. It MUST be technically accurate — never clickbait.

IF AN ANALOGY IS SUPPLIED, USE IT. It is the teacher's own words and it
already works for this audience. Do not replace it with your own. If none is
supplied, only add one if it genuinely helps, and never a strained one.

CODE MUST RUN, AND IT MUST RUN ON ITS OWN. It is executed as a complete
`main.py` in an empty directory, with nothing from any other Meal in scope,
and the Meal is REJECTED if it fails.

This is the one place where continuity does NOT apply. Teaching builds on
earlier Meals; code does not. If an earlier Meal created `soup`, this Meal's
snippet still has to create it again — the imports, the HTML, the parse, all
of it — or it dies with a NameError.

Concretely, every snippet must:
  - import everything it uses
  - define every name it references
  - never reach the network, and never need a package outside the standard
    library — the runner has neither
  - if it reads a file, SHIP THAT FILE in `code.files`. A Meal about reading a
    file should really read one; the file travels with the Meal
  - stay short: the few lines that carry the idea, plus the minimum setup

If teaching the idea honestly needs a page of setup, use a small inline string
instead of a real fetch. A three-line HTML literal is a better teacher than a
network call that cannot run.

If the code needs typed input, supply it in `stdin`. Do NOT write the expected
output — it is captured from a real run.

BE CRISP AND BE ACCURATE. Never invent behaviour Python does not have. If you
are unsure a detail is true, leave it out. A shorter correct Meal beats a
longer one with a wrong claim. Do not repeat yourself and do not pad.

CONTINUITY applies to EXPLANATION, not to code. Earlier Meals are listed
below: do not re-explain what they covered, and never forward-reference a
later one. But every code snippet is still standalone and runnable, as above."""
