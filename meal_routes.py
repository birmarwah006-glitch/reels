"""
meal_routes.py — Meal catalogue and media.

NOT YET MOUNTED. This file is self-contained and changes no existing module.
To serve Meals from the Python backend, add two lines to main.py alongside the
five routers already there:

    from meal_routes import router as meal_router
    app.include_router(meal_router)

Until then the web app's dev server serves the same shapes from the same files
(see web/vite.config.ts), so the frontend is written against this contract and
not against a mock.

Endpoints:
    GET /meals                     the catalogue: every renderable Meal
    GET /meals/{meal_id}           one Meal document
    GET /meals/{meal_id}/video     the rendered 1080x1920 MP4
    GET /meals/{meal_id}/audio     the narration track
    GET /meals/{meal_id}/timing    captions and beat anchors

Reads straight off disk, like /lectures does, so it survives a restart and
needs no database.

Terminology note: the route prefix is /meals because this is a new surface with
no legacy callers. The older /reels and /clipper/reels routes keep their names
— they have clients — and only what a learner READS says "Meal".
